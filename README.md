# wildhorn_sensor_simulator
This repo aims to make a hardware-in-the-loop simulation of the sensor to test the hostboard. 
The goal is to gather sensor from a ROS simulation, send it through serial to a Nucleo Board. 
The Nucleo board will then simulate the behaviour of the sensors and communicate with hostboards using SPI and I2C protocol.
